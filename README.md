This carrier is to support the use of the Boron in outdoor environments.

Major functional goals for the project are:

Temp sensor in case I need to control LiPo charging
External watchdog timer - connect to either Enable or !RST
Single - button on / off so you can leave the battery and power plugged in
The ability for the device to power-cycle itself
ESD and fuse protection
Headers for i2c, SPI and IO
Big capacitor on DC-IN to support Solar Powered use case
External Real Time Clock as the Gen 3 devices lack this functionality.
